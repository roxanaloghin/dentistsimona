      dental treatment but decided to go private based on urgency, location and ratingsâ€¦. One of the best\
      decisions I ever made! I didnt have any new issues\
      however all my existing work was about 5-10 years old\
      and Dr. Simona Loghin suggested a treatment plan to\
      restore and redo a lot of the work. I felt it was too much\
      at first however my teeth have ruined my peace for\
      years and there was something about Simona that\
      made me feel confident in her.. 6 months later all my\
      work is done. I cant believe what Simona has managed\
      to do! Most of it was a breeze, Simona has a magic\
      touch and is so lovely and fearlessly confident in herself\
      and her work. Worth all the time and money!\"",

      as she saved a tooth on crown, which 4 other dentists\
      told me to get rid of because they could not save it.\
      Simona retreated the root canal and used a special\
      technique to build the base of the new crown because\
      the edge of the tooth was initially very short. I have\
      extensive experience with dentists and she is definitely\
      and by far the best.\"",
